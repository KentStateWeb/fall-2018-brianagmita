      <h3>About Our Services</h3>
<div class="accordion-box">
      <button class="accordion">Oil and Oil Filter Service</button>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>Experts recommend changing the oil and oil filter in your vehicle every 3 months or 3,000 miles, whichever is first. It’s an essential way to maximize engine protection.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Engine Oil</button>
        <div class="panel"><p>Engine oil is what lubricates a car’s engine, allowing it to run smoothly and last longer. Car owners must maintain their cars’ engines by changing the oil and using the oil appropriate for their cars’ makes and models. Every car comes with a check oil light and an oil filter under the hood. These components allow car owners to monitor their oil levels and add oil as needed without having to hire a mechanic.</p>
        </div>
      <button class="accordion"> Changing the Oil </button>
      <div class="panel"><p>An important part of routine car maintenance is changing the oil regularly. The necessary frequency of oil changes has become a point of contention among experts. The Engine Oil Bible maintains that engine oil can’t be changed often enough, but Nordic Group insists that, with the advent of detergent oils and multi-weight oils, some vehicles can go as far as 6,000 miles before needing an oil change. The best course of action is to check the owner’s manual and follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.
An obvious benefit of changing one’s own oil is saving money, but oil change services frequently advertise bargains. If the check engine oil light comes on when you’re driving, this is a strong indication that the car is running low on oil. A driver does not need a mechanic to add oil. However, if the oil light stays on or lights up shortly after adding oil, there may be a leak, and a mechanic should look at the car.

      <button class="accordion"> Brake Service </button>
      <div class="panel"><p>Brakes are crucial to keeping you and your loved ones safe on the road. If you have ever had problems with your brakes, you can attest to the fact that it can be a terrible experience. By having your brakes inspected twice a year, you can protect yourself and your passengers, and you can save money by catching any problems before they become too costly.
Inspecting your brakes twice a year for wear and damage can protect you and your passengers. Additionally, it will help you save money by catching any damage before it becomes too costly.
      <br /> What do we check during our inspection of your brakes?
The master cylinder is the heart of your vehicle’s braking system, and it holds the brake fluid when it is not being delivered to the brakes through the brake lines. If brake fluid leaks because the master cylinder is worn or brake lines are plugged or broken, the fluid cannot be delivered, and the brake pads will become ruined. When Cortland Auto Repair inspects your brakes, we will make sure the master cylinder is in good condition.
    <br />The brake fluid itself can become dirty or contaminated as it draws rust-causing moisture and picks up other debris, or it can break down from excess heat. Clean brake fluid is either clear or slightly yellow while dirty brake fluid may be brown or even black. Old and dirty brake fluid can damage brake systems internally. During your brake inspection at Cortland Auto Repair, we will check your brake fluid to make sure it is clean.
  <br />The brake lines connect to the master cylinder through a combination valve, which combines metering and proportioning valves. It regulates the pressure on the front and rear wheels to make sure both sets of brakes are applied simultaneously. A malfunctioning combination valve can cause the wheels to lock up. To ensure your safety, the experts at Cortland Auto Repairwill make sure your vehicle’s combination valve is working properly.
<br />Brake pads and shoes can be made of ceramic, metal or organic materials while the disk rotors and drums they press against are made of metal. Because pads and shoes create friction to stop the car, they gradually wear down over time and may wear away completely, letting the metal of the calipers and cylinders to which they are attached grind against the rotors and drums and damage them. Some pads have a metal strip attached to them that sounds a warning whistle when the pad becomes too worn, but this strip sounds only when the car is in motion and the brakes are not applied. When we inspect your brakes, we will make sure your brake pads are in good condition.

      <button class="accordion"> Tire Pressure Monitoring </button>
      <div class="panel"><p>Most people ignore their tires, yet tires are undoubtedly a critical safety component on a vehicle. Where the rubber meets the road affects traction, handling, steering, stability and braking. Because of this, a sudden tire failure can have serious consequences, especially if it occurs when operating at high speeds.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Nearly 250,000 accidents occur in the United States per year due to low tire pressure.</li>
                  <li>About 75 percent of roadside flats are preceded by a slow leak or under-inflation.</li>
                  <li>According to a recent survey, America could reduce its fuel consumption by 10 percent and save a collective $2 billion a year by keeping tires properly inflated.</li>
                  <li>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that tire pressure monitoring systems could prevent as many as 79 deaths and 10,365 injuries each year in the United States.</li>
                </ul>
      <p>What are the effects of under-inflation?<br />
Annually, an estimated 23,000 accidents and 535 fatal accidents involve blowouts or flat tires. Maintaining proper tire air pressure is not only a major safety concern but can also affect the handling and performance of your vehicle.<br />
Why is it more expensive and time-consuming to have tires serviced rather than rotated?<br />
Technicians use special diagnostic tools to test and recalibrate sensors any time a tire is moved from one location on the vehicle to another. A sensor must be tested to make sure it is functioning correctly and also must be reprogrammed whenever tires are moved from one position to another during rotation. OEMs recommend a sensor service kit be installed every time a tire is serviced. These kits include replacement parts to properly service the sensor. Sensors are powered by a battery that usually has a life of 6 to 8 years. The sensor has to be replaced when the battery fails because the sensor’s batteries are not replaceable.
