          <p><span>Automotive Professionals</span>"I have dealt with Todd, Brian and the rest of the team at Wrench for over 7 years. The best way to judge a shop is when your entire experience has been completed you then ask yourself, "would I send my mother here to get her repairs done?" I can answer "yes" to that question! I deal with 350 accounts over a span of 7 different counties and have some idea of what people are looking for and Wrench fits that model. They participate in all of Jasper Engines & Transmissions technical and professional training. They are equipped with all the latest tooling to be able to diagnose and repair your car in a professional manner. If I can recommend my mother there I can certainly recommend you as well."</p>

          <p><span>Corvette Repair</span>"I recently had the team at Wrench Auto perform an engine replacement on my 1973 Corvette...not a minor repair to say the least. Todd, Brian, and the entire team were extremely professional, a pleasure to work with, and they did a fantastic job installing the new Jasper high performance engine. I would highly recommend Wrench Auto to anyone."</p>
