      <h1>FAQs</h1>

      <div class="accordion-box">
        <button class="accordion">How often should I rotate my tires?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Your tires should be rotated every other oil change or every 6,000 miles. Neglecting to rotate tires is a major cause of premature tire wear.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is it really necessary to replace my timing belt at the manufacturer-recommended intervals?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>YES. The failure of a timing belt in many cars can result in major engine damage. The cost of repairing an engine with a broken timing belt is much greater than the cost of a timing belt replacement.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What does it mean if my check engine or service engine soon light comes on?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>There are many sensors and computerized components that manage your vehicle’s engine performance and emissions. When one of these fails, the check engine light is illuminated. Although your car may seem to run fine, it is important to have the issue addressed to prevent long-term problems or failure of emission tests.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What should I do if my car starts to overheat?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>This is a very serious problem. If your car overheats for too long, you can damage your engine. Find a safe place to pull off the road and shut off the engine as soon as possible. Do not attempt to check the fluid level in the radiator as it can burn you. The best thing to do is have your car towed to a repair shop.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">When should I get my oil changed?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>You should get your oil changed every 3,000 miles or as recommended in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. If intervals are extended, ensure you use oil that is capable of extended mileage changes.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What causes milky brown engine oil?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>LMilky brown engine oil is an indication of coolant in the oil. This can be caused by a blown head gasket or other gasket, a failed transmission cooler or cracked casings. This condition is very serious and needs to be checked by a professional technician quickly.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is synthetic motor oil?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Synthetic motor oils are made of artificial materials. They can be a good choice for high output, turbocharged or supercharged engines, vehicles that are used for towing (especially during hot weather) or vehicles that are operated in extremely cold or hot climates. Synthetic motor oils, though several times more expensive than mineral-based motor oils, can improve fuel economy and provide longer intervals between changes. They also provide instant lubrication on start-up.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">When should I replace my car’s fuel filter?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>To help ensure dependable, trouble-free performance, replace your car’s fuel filter approximately every 30,000 miles or as recommended in your vehicle’s owner’s manual.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">I need to replace a burned out fuse. What should I do?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Always replace burned out fuses with ones of the same amperage (printed on the fuse) and note that if a fuse continues to blow, you should have the circuit checked professionally by one of our technicians for defects.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How do I know when to replace my brakes?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If you hear squeaks, squeals, grinding or other noises, there could be a problem. The exception to this rule is if your car has been exposed to moisture recently. Moisture can cause a thin layer of rust to develop, and slight squeaking immediately after rain is not unusual. If the squeaking continues, have your brakes inspected. Periodically check wear on your brake pads through the spaces between your wheels’ spokes. The outside pad will be pressed against a metal rotor, and there should be at least ¼ inch of pad. Any less, and you’ll want to have the pads inspected or replaced.</p>
